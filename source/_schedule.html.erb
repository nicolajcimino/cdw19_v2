		<h4>Events are not quite live, but here is a preview of what our line-up looks like</h4>
		<p class="small">We are focused on bringing you the highest quality programming and most rewarding experiences. You asked for it, and we listened! We’ve heard for years that our community wanted more quality time at events, to make better connections, speak with the presenters, and enjoy the spirit of the moment. With that in mind, each day of Design Week will feature 2 events that are a minimum of an hour and a half in length. In addition to bringing back some well-loved favorites, (we see you, Agency Crawl!) other events presented this week pair up with our most popular initiatives as well as some amazing area companies. See the schedule below for more details!</p>
